# Chat application

Done with NestJS, ReactJS and Socket IO.

## Idea

The overall idea of the application is to provide users with an opportunity to create a topic to discuss with other people. First, a user enters the so-called "corridor", where he can choose from existing chat rooms with topics to debate over. If not satisfied with the list, one can add his own topic, go to a new room and wait for opponents to join.

## Installation and running

Open terminal in the <b>server</b> folder. Install dependencies with the command:

```
yarn
```

Build the server:

```
yarn run build
```

Start the server:

```
yarn start
```

Open terminal in the <b>client</b> folder. Install dependencies:

```
yarn
```

Build the client:

```
yarn build-prod
```

Start the client:

```
yarn start
```

The client will be automatically opened in a tab and served on port 8081.
